This forensic investigation is related to Operation Narcos, as it began with two passengers intercepted and searched by a Wellington Customs Officer, following intelligence provided by the Australian Government. The suspects, who were found in possession of methamphetamine and other illegal materials, are believed to be involved in a more extensive drug distribution network.  
Forensic analysis was required in this case as digital devices, including two laptops and a desktop computer, were seized from the suspect's residence, which may hold evidence of illicit activities.  
Various digital forensic tools like FTK imager, Autopsy, Bulk extractor, software write blocker, etc., along with the best practices, were employed to maintain the sanctity of the evidence acquired.  

The artifacts collected are summarized in the report.
